// What is Array :- An array in JavaScript is a special variable that can hold 
//                  multiple values in a single variable. 
//                  It is a data structure used to store collections of data,
//                  such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.
//                  Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed.


// Creating Array
// There are multiple way to create Array
let emptyArr = [];
let name = ["IRONMAN", "THOR", "HULK", "WANDA", "ANTMAN", "THANOS"];
let marks = [23, 25, 68, 45.5];
let mix = ["Titan", "Vormir", 25, 56]

console.log(emptyArr);
console.log(name);
console.log(marks);
console.log(mix);
